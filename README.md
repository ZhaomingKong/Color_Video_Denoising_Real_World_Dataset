# Color_Video_Denoising_Real_World_Dataset
A real world dataset for color video denoising

Similar to our color image dataset, we are trying to construct a real world dataset for color video denoising.

Each dataset includes noisy/mean color video pairs. Notice that due to the limitation of our devices, we are not able to produce completely noise-free videos, but the mean videos are much more visually pleasant and may be considered roughly as ground-truth ones.

BC/FC means back/front camera. More information and data will be released.

Our datasets are publicly available at https://pan.baidu.com/s/1D3w9zOZwGKggzQW2jniDGw. To access the data, you may need to install BaiduNet disk (available at https://pan.baidu.com/download/). Please contact Zhaoming Kong (kong.zm@mail.scut.edu.cn) for the password.
